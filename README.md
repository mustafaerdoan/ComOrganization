An unoptimized matrix multiplication code is given with .cu extension. 
1.	Run it in a CUDA project and record the execution time. 
2.	Get the functions for matrix multiplication with shared memory  and add to your project. Do necessary arrangements and calculate the product matrix C2 on GPU. Compare C1 and C2 element by element using a for loop and make sure that the GPU code is working correctly.
3.	You can change the ARRAY_SIZE as 256, 512, 768, 1024 and 1280 to measure the run times for CPU and GPU implementations.
Finally, pictures that I added show my measurements for both CPU and GPU
